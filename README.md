This project started out with a bunch of miscellaneous small programs that I wrote
to prepare for technical job interviews.

After a little while, I started contributing many of the examples to <a href="http://rosettacode.org">Rosetta Code</a>,
particularly the <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> examples.

Most of these programs are toys, but one program is practical in nature: rosetta_crawl.coffee was used
by me to create this site: <a href="http://shpaml.webfactional.com/misc/RosettaCoffee/code.htm">CoffeeScript Examples from
Rosetta Code</a>.
